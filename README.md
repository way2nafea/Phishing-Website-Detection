# Phishing Website Detection System

## 📌 Overview
The **Phishing Website Detection System** is a machine learning–based web application designed to identify and classify phishing websites using URL and website-based features. The system helps users determine whether a given website URL is **legitimate or phishing**, improving online security and awareness.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect phishing websites using machine learning techniques  
- Analyze URL-based and website-related features  
- Provide a simple web interface for real-time URL checking  
- Reduce the risk of phishing attacks and fraudulent websites  

---

## 🧠 Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Flask  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Deployment:** Render  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. User enters a website URL  
2. URL features are extracted using predefined rules  
3. Trained ML model predicts whether the website is phishing or legitimate  
4. Result is displayed on the web interface

## 🚀 How It Works
- The model is trained using a dataset containing phishing and legitimate URLs.
- Features such as URL length, presence of special characters, domain age, and HTTPS usage are extracted.
- A machine learning classifier predicts the nature of the URL.
- The Flask web app provides an interface to test URLs in real time.
